"""End-to-end tests for stepwise previews, driven through the CLI.

The unit tests in ``test_stepwise.py`` cover window resolution, naming and
failure isolation with stub decoders. They cannot answer the two questions that
actually matter once the feature ships:

1. Does a real generation produce previews that are valid, animated, and
   openable?
2. Does asking for previews change the generated video?

(2) is the load-bearing one. Previews tap the denoising loop and hold the VAE
decoder resident through it, so "opt-in and inert" is a claim about a code path
that unit tests with stub decoders never exercise. These tests assert it by
running the same seed twice through the real CLI and comparing the output MP4
byte for byte.

Marked ``slow``: needs the q8 weights and runs two full generations
(~4 minutes on an M2 Pro). Run with::

    uv run pytest tests/test_stepwise_e2e.py -m slow -v -s
